# About

SPARCED is a simple and efficient pipeline for constructing, merging, expanding
and simulating large-scale, single-cell mechanistic models.

With minimal set-up, users can configure small-scale experiments on their local
machines, is it through pure Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks.
SPARCED is also compatible with cluster running and parallelization.

The acronym SPARCED stands for _**S**BML, **P**roliferation, **A**poptosis,
**R**eceptor signaling, **C**ell cycle, **E**xpression & **D**NA damage_, which
are sub-models of the large-scale mechanistic model.

SPARCED is a product of the [Birtwistle Lab](http://www.birtwistlelab.com/) and the [Erdem Lab](https://erdemlab.github.io/).
